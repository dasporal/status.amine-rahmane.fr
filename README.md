# Status Page

I was curious about how one would go about setting up their own status page for their projects, and thought it would be a nice week-end challenge, along with helping me improve my Go coding skills, as I've never had the opportunity or took the time to participate in various Go open-source projects.

There's probably a lot of beginner mistakes in there, but it's all part of the fun. :)

I've still got a bunch of other features I want to implement, things to do to improve performances and use the project as some sort of sandbox for whichever ideas I want to toy with (mainly thinking about Authkit).

Vite app is stored in `./src` and the Go modules for the functions in `./netlify`

## Frontend
- React (w/ Vite)
- ShadCN & Tailwind

## Backend
- Netlify (w/ Functions)
- Go
- Supabase
- Bruno collections available at `./netlify/collections`


## Planned
- More detailed views for each websites and events
- Implement alerts 
- ~~Offload some client-side logic to the Netlify Functions~~
- ~~Cache data~~
- Generate Skeleton Cards based on number of websites instead of arbitrary number
